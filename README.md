CSCI 183 Final Project: Forest Fire Prediction

Steps to Complete Project: 

--> 1: Look at existing dataset and run correlation models
--> 2: Find features that best determine whether a forest fire would occur
--> 3: Figure out best ML Model to use
--> 4: Train model with dataset
--> 5: Find other data online that has the same features and test model with that data
--> 6: Look at errors and evaluate the accuracy of the model.
